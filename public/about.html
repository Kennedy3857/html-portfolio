<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>My name is Kennedy O'Connor and I am a Graphic Designer for Western Digital. Some of my favorite designers include 
  Zipeng Zhu and Jessica Hische. I love their work in typography. I am thrilled to be learning to code.  I think this will greatly improve my understanding of HTML and coding as it
  relates to web design.</p>

<p>I grew up in Atlanta, Georgia with my family. I went to college in Orlando, Florida and had a great experience. I studied
  graphic design. I had multiple internships throughout my time in college. I gained a lot of experience working for these
  companies which led me to my current job.</p>

<p>With this experience in coding I want to be able to take my career in a different direction, increase my salary, and develop my skills.</p>
